3/12

Go over comments and requirements doc.
VOPC diagrams option not available on free edition.

This program may be greatly flawed, but at least we did something.
I don't know if we'll get the problem solving marks, a lot of this was difficult enough,
coupled with the fact we had no idea for our project until one week into it.
Serialisation has failed.
JavaDoc: I doubt I'll get anything for this.

After all this, email the link to him.


pharmacy

staff login - account class
manager adds medication, add/remove staff
reg. pull up customer details + prescriptions
staff can add details aout customer
staff can add presc ripotion 


prescriptions class - arraylist
pres. = collection of medications
brand name, price, categories (cough, cold, skin care, eye care)

search

renewal prescription

name +address

calender - prescription interval e.g. 1 month (attribute = interval)
prescription issued - collection for prescriptions for calender (dateissued per prescription) to check when it was issued to a customer
if too recent error message saying how many days to wait


find most popular medication in  past month (if time)


prescription has dateissued to tell how long to wait before renewal

arraylist of prescriptions, loop through medications. find most frequently isseud medcation

binary search

combobox medication choice

try catch code for I/O, check Lab 15

validation

eircode validation, link to rules

complexity is things outside notes

dispose method

user logs in 3 times and fails - contact system admin for password. manager can create new passwords. manager can know what the password is

This is going a little better than I thought, but we will still lag behind. there are other things to go into this project:
presentation
clean code (labsheet 17)
VOPC diagram
requirements document (1 page)
JavaDoc comments (labsheet 17)

questions:
main menu: different depending on manager/staff login or grey out options if staff?
Serializable NEEDS to be implemented. we have to figure this out. can a class implement two things at once e.g. ActionListener & Serializable?
better way for dates?
password necessary? put in comments or in presentation. 3 attempts = contact sysadmin.

do calendar math to report how long working here

new Account(user, pass). getAccount to get accounts
manager logs themselves in.
two radio buttons: one for reg staff and other for manager for staff type.


manager is-a staff. manager has staffManaged to differentiate. has composition releationship with staff
category attribute - staff  = "staff". overridden in manager to say "manager"

date chooser in folder somewhere

staff has a account (Account account) for logging in arraylist, not "is a"



drugs:
*Thiosonide
*Aeromara
*Nutritriptan

Bactrosone
Microgard
Naftitamine
Choczin
Pantestryl Meprobicin
Soditriptan Tramapirone
Floxusporine Ergonafine

can grab categories from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication


find a birthday generator
adding dates needs to be easier
dateissued still has to be implemented onprescription


28/11
should managers have staffID, managerID or nothing?????

Main menu:
    Add/Edit Staff
    Add/Edit Medicine
    Prescribe Medicine

For Christ sake add Serializable

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4548816/when-should-we-implement-serializable-interface
basically serialization is bad because it causes security flaws.
I'm still going to use it. when I get better at this program I'll use something better like YAML or HJSON.
